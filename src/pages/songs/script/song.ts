  I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
\n
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
\n
Baby I'm, dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to, our favorite song
When you said you, looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling you, look perfect tonight
\n
I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a lover to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
\n
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
\n
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight
\n
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
  \n
